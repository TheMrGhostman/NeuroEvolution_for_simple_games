Implementation of NeuroEvolution of weights for fixed Neural Network architecture. 
Tested on CartPole and BipedaWalker from openai gym

-> CartPole was solved in 38 generations! (simple task)
-> BipedaWalker was not solved! It would need tune parameters (regression with 4 outputs is much more complex)
